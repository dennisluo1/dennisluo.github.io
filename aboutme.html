        Hi! My name is Dennis and welcome to my page.
        I am a graduate of Skidmore College's class of 2015. While a student at Skidmore
        College, I pursued my degree in business management while running the college's 
        American Red Cross Club as Vice President. I had the opportunity to take my interests 
        in business and culture by spending a semester in Barcelona. After graduating from Skidmore College, 
        I decided to spend some time volunteering for the Salvation Army until ultimately leaving for a teach abroad
        opportunity in Colombia where I put my passion for business and non-profit to practice.
        After returning home from Colombia, I began working at an Apple Store's Genius Bar before
        picking up an interest in coding and programming. My deep interests in coding led to an 
        opportunity to become a part of General Assembly's Web Development Immersive Class!
