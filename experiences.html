            <div class="item-text">Perhaps one of my most rewarding and humbling experiences, 
            I had the opportunity to work as a volunteer English co-teacher at a public school located in a town 
            just outside of the Colombian capital. At Instituci√≥n Educativa La Merced, I worked alongside four 
            lead English teachers in teaching a total of eight classes ranging from grades nine to eleven. Additionally
            I created and led an after school English conversation club to further expose students 
            to the culture and language of the English speaking world.
